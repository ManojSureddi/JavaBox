# JavaBox
This is a java execution environment that can be used to write and run java code in your browser with ease.

There is a coding arena where you can type in your code and execute it.As of now the application only supports java.I will try to extend its suport to multiple languages as well.

The result arena will give you the code results including the stacktrace if there are any errors
